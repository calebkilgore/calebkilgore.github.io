      <h3>Leveling</h3>
        <img src="https://monchew.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/levelflow.jpg">
        <p>First, you will be in your starting zone and you should do all the quest because it is the right content for you. Then you want to go to the next ranked land.  Now you want to do some PVP or dungeon content.  Equip that gear you got, if it is better and you will get more powerful and be able to kill things with ease.  Go to new continents and fight new things and experience new lore and content.  Now don't think when you are level capped that the game is over, you have much to go.  There will be more expansions with new content.  Remember there is a level character boost but you will not get the game experience if you use it and you won't know how to play so, do not use a boost.  </p>

      <h3>Combat</h3>
        <img src=http://masterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/World-of-Warcraft.jpg>
        <p>First you look at your health and mana it is in the top left corner of the screen.  The green is your health and the blue is your mana.  There is also a yellow bar or a red bar depending on your class.  If your health is all the way up then you can start to fight.  You will have spells at the bottom of the screen and they will take from your blue, red, or yellow bar but if you are a red bar class auto attack will get it up.  Now read your spells and see what you get now target a mob by clicking on them.  Now cast a spell on them and it might not kill them on the first hit but it will do damage.  Then do auto attack and cast your spells to do more damage until they die.  There are also healing spells and different spells for different things.  You will get more spells and you can make more combos and do new awesome moves.  </p>
