      <h3>Leveling</h3>
        <img src="https://monchew.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/levelflow.jpg">
        <p>click <a href="https://monchew.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/levelflow.jpg">HERE</a> for a bigger map to see where you should go next. First, you will be in your starting zone and you should do all the quest because it is the right content for you. Then you want to go to the next ranked land.  Now you want to do some PVP or dungeon content.  Equip that gear you got, if it is better and you will get more powerful and be able to kill things with ease.  Go to new continents and fight new things and experience new lore and content.  Now don't think when you are level capped that the game is over, you have much to go.  There will be more expansions with new content.  Remember there is a level character boost but you will not get the game experience if you use it and you won't know how to play so, do not use a boost.  </p>

      <h3>Combat</h3>
        <img src=http://masterherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/World-of-Warcraft.jpg>
        <p>First you look at your health and mana it is in the top left corner of the screen.  The green is your health and the blue is your mana.  There is also a yellow bar or a red bar depending on your class.  If your health is all the way up then you can start to fight.  You will have spells at the bottom of the screen and they will take from your blue, red, or yellow bar but if you are a red bar class auto attack will get it up.  Now read your spells and see what you get now target a mob by clicking on them.  Now cast a spell on them and it might not kill them on the first hit but it will do damage.  Then do auto attack and cast your spells to do more damage until they die.  There are also healing spells and different spells for different things.  You will get more spells and you can make more combos and do new awesome moves.  </p>

        <h3>Battle Grounds/Raids and Dungeons</h3>
        <img src="http://battlehelper.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/wow-fotm-best-class-pvp.jpg">
        <p>First you want to get your friends and if you have no friends then click the instance finder. Next select the dungeon or raid you want to do and it will get a group for you. Then when you get in, you will be teleported in.  I am going to cover raids and dungeons first. First you are in a group which you need to go through the obsticals together. You will not get attacked unless you go near so dont disapoint your group with ahhh they are chasing me ahhh. Next there are bosses at certain points which are harder than normal mobs.  Once you kill the boss you will get armor which you can equip.  And each raid or dungeon is different so if you do not know the fight ask a teamate they would rather explain than die. Battle grounds are pvp which means you are fighting players and they can attack you at any time so you need to be ready at any time. Now the battle grounds there are three types conquest, capture the flag, arenas, and open world battle grounds. Conquest is where you have to capture the base and keep it there until you get the required amount of points then you win. Capture the flag is where you need to get the bases and capture the flag and bring it back to the base until you get the right amount of points. Now the open world ones they are many of them and they are harder and very complex and different that i cant cover them all. Arenas are when you go into a pit whith a few playeres and fight other players and whoever dies first loses.   </p>
